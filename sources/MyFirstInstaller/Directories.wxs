        Step 4: The Directories
        ====================================================================================================

        This is the place where we describe the directory hierarchy. The directories are referenced, later,
        in this installer by the components. Each component must have a base directory.
        Check out the "FileComponents.wxs" file to see how the directories are used.
        
        Note: The directories are really created on disk only when the files are actually deployed in that
        directory. If no file is deployed in a directory, it is not created, even if it is mentioned here.
        
        The "Name" attribute is the name of the directory as it will be created on the disk.
        The "Id" attribute is used only in WiX, to reference the directory.
