                Step 3: The File
                ====================================================================================================

                In general, you should restrict yourself to a single element, in this case a file per component.
                The Windows Installer is designed to support thousands of components in a single installer, so
                unless you have a very good reason, keep to one file per component. 
                
                In the repair process, only the main file of the component can be repaired.
                
                The file is deployed in the directory mentioned by the <Component> or the <ComponentGroup>.
                In our example, the <ComponentGroup> is the one that specifies the directory.
                The directory is indicated only by its id, in this case "INSTALLFOLDER". To find out the actual path
                where the file will be installed, we must look into the "Directories.wxs" file.
                
                NEXT: Directories.wxs

                <File Id="DummyFile" Source="$(var.ProjectDir)dummy.txt" KeyPath="yes" />

            </Component>

        </ComponentGroup>
