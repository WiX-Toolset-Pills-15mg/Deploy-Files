# My First Installer

## Description

This Pill demonstrates how to create an installer that deploys a single file in the installation directory.

## How to use

### a) Tutorial (article)

-  [doc/article/README.md](doc/article/README.md)
- This document contains a step-by-step tutorial. You can find there explanations on solving the described problem.

### b) Code example

- [sources](sources)
- I provided the complete Visual Studio solution that solves the described problem. Check it out whenever you fill the need to test it by yourself, in your environment or if you have further ideas that you want to verify.

### c) Code notes

- A shorter version of the tutorial can be found directly in the source code. Open Visual Studio solution and search (Ctrl+Shift+F) for the `START` comment, then follow the `Step` comments.

**Note:** The `NEXT` tags at the end of each comment indicates the file where to search for the next `Step`.

### d) Log file examples

- [doc/logs](doc/logs)
- Sometimes a quick look into the log files may be useful, but running the installer each time is cumbersome. I generated the log files for what I thought are the meaningful scenarios and I placed them into this directory. Have a look when needed.

### e) Kata

- [doc/kata/README.md](doc/kata/README.md)
- I think that a good practice for someone that just starts to learn WiX Toolset is to exercise daily in order to get familiar with the concepts. This project can be used as a kata and this document contains instructions on how to perform it.

- When this kata is mastered, there are other exercises that are worth looking at:
  - [Immediate Custom Action](https://github.com/WiX-Toolset-Pills-15mg/Immediate-Custom-Action)
  - [Deferred Custom Action](https://github.com/WiX-Toolset-Pills-15mg/Deferred-Custom-Action)
  - [Bundle with MSI](https://github.com/WiX-Toolset-Pills-15mg/Bundle-with-MSI)
