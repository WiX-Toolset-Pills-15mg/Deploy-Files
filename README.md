# My First Installer

## Description

This Pill demonstrates how to create an installer that deploys a single file in the installation directory.

## Content

### a) Tutorial (article)

A step-by-step tutorial can be found in the [doc/article/README.md](doc/article/README.md) document. You can find there explanations on solving the described problem.

### b) Code example

The complete Visual Studio solution that solves the described problem can be found in the [sources](sources) directory.

### c) Code notes

A shorter version of the tutorial can be found directly in the source code. Open Visual Studio solution and search (Ctrl+Shift+F) for the `START` comment, then follow the `Step` comments.

**Note:** The `NEXT` tags at the end of each comment indicates the file where to search for the next `Step`.

### d) Log file examples

Sometimes a quick look into the log files may be necessary, but running the installer each time may be cumbersome. I generated the log files for the scenarios mentioned in the tutorial and I placed them into the [doc/logs](doc/logs) directory. Use them when needed.

### e) Kata

I think that a good practice for someone that just starts to learn WiX Toolset is to exercise daily in order to get familiar with the concepts. This project can be used as a kata and exercised daily for a number of days.

In the [doc/kata/README.md](doc/kata/README.md) document there are instructions on how to perform the kata.

When this kata is mastered, there are other exercises that are worth looking at:

- [Immediate Custom Action](https://github.com/WiX-Toolset-Pills-15mg/Immediate-Custom-Action)
- [Deferred Custom Action](https://github.com/WiX-Toolset-Pills-15mg/Deferred-Custom-Action)
- [Bundle with MSI](https://github.com/WiX-Toolset-Pills-15mg/Bundle-with-MSI)
